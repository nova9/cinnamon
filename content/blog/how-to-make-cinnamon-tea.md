Cinnamon tea is a warm, comforting beverage that’s easy to make and packed with flavor. Here’s how you can prepare it at home:

## Ingredients
- 1 cinnamon stick (or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon)
- 1 cup water
- Optional: honey, lemon, or ginger for extra flavor

## Instructions
1. **Boil the Water:** Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small pot.
2. **Add Cinnamon:** Add the cinnamon stick (or ground cinnamon) to the boiling water.
3. **Simmer:** Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5–10 minutes. The longer it simmers, the stronger the flavor.
4. **Strain and Serve:** Remove the cinnamon stick or strain the tea if using ground cinnamon. Pour into a cup.
5. **Add Extras:** Sweeten with honey, add a slice of lemon, or a bit of ginger if desired.

## Tips
- Use Ceylon cinnamon for a sweeter, more delicate flavor.
- Enjoy hot or let it cool and serve over ice for a refreshing iced cinnamon tea.

Enjoy your homemade cinnamon tea!
