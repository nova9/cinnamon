While cinnamon offers several potential health benefits, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or supplement routine. Below are some of the key health benefits associated with cinnamon.

## 5. Antimicrobial Effects

Cinnamon exhibits antimicrobial properties, which can help inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and fungi. This may support immune health and contribute to oral and digestive well-being.
