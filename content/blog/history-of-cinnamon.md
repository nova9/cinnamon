Cinnamon is one of the worldâ€™s oldest and most beloved spices. Its story begins thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt, where it was prized for its fragrance, medicinal properties, and use in embalming. Traders from Arabia brought cinnamon to Europe, where it became a symbol of wealth and luxury. 

During the Middle Ages, cinnamon was so valuable that wars were fought over its control. The Portuguese, Dutch, and British all vied for dominance over the spice trade, particularly in Sri Lanka, where the finest cinnamon was grown. Today, cinnamon is a staple in kitchens around the globe, used in both sweet and savory dishes. Its warm, sweet aroma continues to captivate people, making it a timeless favorite.
