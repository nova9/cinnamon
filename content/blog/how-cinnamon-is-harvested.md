Cinnamon is harvested from the inner bark of trees belonging to the Cinnamomum genus. The process begins by cutting the stems of the tree and scraping off the outer bark. The inner bark is then carefully peeled away in long strips, which curl into quills as they dry.

After drying, the quills are cut into sticks or ground into powder. The quality of cinnamon depends on factors like the age of the tree, the climate, and the skill of the harvesters. Traditional methods are still used in many regions, ensuring that each batch of cinnamon retains its unique flavor and aroma.


## A Closer Look at the Harvesting Process

Cinnamon is primarily harvested in countries such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, and Vietnam. The process is often carried out by skilled workers who have inherited their knowledge through generations. Harvesting typically takes place during the rainy season, when the bark is more pliable and easier to peel.

The tools used are simple but effective: a small, curved knife for scraping and peeling, and sometimes a brass rod to help separate the bark. Workers carefully select mature stems, usually about two years old, to ensure the best quality. The outer bark is removed first, then the inner bark is loosened by gently beating the stem before it is peeled away in long, thin strips.

Once peeled, the bark strips are rolled by hand to encourage the characteristic curling. These quills are then dried in the shade to preserve their delicate aroma and flavor. In some regions, the quills are layered inside one another to form compound quills, which are later sorted and graded by size, color, and texture.

## Post-Harvest Processing and Grading

After drying, cinnamon quills are cut to uniform lengths and bundled for sale. Some are ground into powder, while others are left as sticks. The grading process is meticulous: the highest grades are thin, smooth, and light in color, while lower grades may be thicker or have a rougher texture. The best cinnamon, such as Ceylon cinnamon from Sri Lanka, is prized for its sweet, delicate flavor and is often referred to as "true cinnamon."

The entire process, from harvesting to grading, relies on the expertise of local communities. Their traditional methods not only preserve the quality of the spice but also support sustainable agriculture and the livelihoods of those who produce it.
