      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not all cinnamon is created equal. The two main types are Cassia and Ceylon. Cassia cinnamon, which is darker and has a stronger flavor, is the most common variety found in supermarkets. It is grown mainly in China and Indonesia. Ceylon cinnamon, also known as &amp;ldquo;true cinnamon,&amp;rdquo; is lighter in color and has a more delicate, sweet flavor. It is primarily grown in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ceylon cinnamon is considered superior for its subtle taste and lower coumarin content, which makes it safer for regular consumption. When shopping for cinnamon, check the label to see which type you’re buying. For everyday use, especially in large quantities, Ceylon is the preferred choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/how-cinnamon-is-harvested-and-processed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon is harvested from the inner bark of trees belonging to the Cinnamomum genus. The process begins by cutting the stems of the tree and scraping off the outer bark. The inner bark is then carefully peeled away in long strips, which curl into quills as they dry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After drying, the quills are cut into sticks or ground into powder. The quality of cinnamon depends on factors like the age of the tree, the climate, and the skill of the harvesters. Traditional methods are still used in many regions, ensuring that each batch of cinnamon retains its unique flavor and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
